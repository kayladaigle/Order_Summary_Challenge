## My process

I started with laying out the structure of my html. Sepearting sections into divs and preparing the
html elements for my css stylesheet. After I completed the basic structure of my HTML I got to styling. Stating first with the background and then working my way down the order summary card. I also started with a mobile view instead of the desktop view. I usually start with desktop but this time I wanted to try something different.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


```css
.container {
  position: absolute;
}
.container {
  box-shadow: 0 8px 15px hsl(224,23%,55%);
}
.container {
  vertical-align: middle;
}
.container {
  display: inline-block;
}
.container:hover {
  color: #ffffff;
}
```

Above are some CSS properties that I learned while completing this project. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Position Property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - This source helped me understand the CSS Position Property. Using this property I was able to allow divs to overlap each other.
- [CSS Button](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp) - This resource helped me build the buttons for the order summary.
